-- We want to start by looking at our data and familiarise ourselves with the various columns and data types.

SELECT * 
FROM netflix_titles
LIMIT 10

-- We find that there are 12 columns in this dataset, including the title, year released, cast list, director, country, description, among others.

-- Next, we want to find out what the distribution between movies and tv shows is like.
-- The below code calculates the average content type and groups it.

SELECT type, ROUND(COUNT(*) *100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) from netflix_titles ),0) AS perc_total
FROM netflix_titles 
GROUP By type

-- Here we find out that 70% of the content is made up of movies, and the remaining 30% of TV shows.
