-- In this project, we want to investigate if there is a positive correlation between Netflix subscriptions and the average salary. In addition, does the amount of 
-- content available in a given country affect subscription numbers? The assumption is that the higher the average income then the more likely it is that 
-- subscription prices are higher in a given country.


-- Let's start by looking at our datasets - there are two in total. First, we look at the Netflix subscriptions dataset.

SELECT * FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions
LIMIT 10;

-- This dataset gives us the majority of information, including the library size and monthly cost packages per country. The columns are the following:
-- Country | Total_Library_Size | No__of_TV_Shows | No__of_Movies | Cost_Per_Month___Basic____ | Cost_Per_Month___Standard___ | Cost_Per_Month___Premium____

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions;
-- There are a total of 65 rows in this set.

-- Next, let's understand the split between the two types of content across the countries.

SELECT
    Country AS country,
    ROUND((No__of_TV_Shows/Total_Library_Size),2) AS perc_tv,
    ROUND((No__of_Movies/Total_Library_Size),2) AS perc_movies,
    Total_Library_Size AS total_library
 FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions
 ORDER BY Total_Library_Size;

-- From the above, it seems that we have roughly a 65%-70% weighting towards TV shows and 35%-30% towards Movies, but let's be sure by calculating
-- the average values across the dataset.

SELECT AVG((No__of_TV_Shows/Total_Library_Size)) AS perc_tv_total
FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions; -- 66% TV Shows

SELECT AVG((No__of_Movies/Total_Library_Size)) AS pec_movies_total
FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions; -- 34% Movies

-- Looking at library size:

SELECT * FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions
ORDER BY Total_Library_Size DESC

-- From the above query, we can see that the top 5 countries with the largest libraries are: Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and United Kingdom.
-- Interestingly enough, before this analysis began, one of the assumptions made was that the US would have the largest library sizes.
-- This was expected due to the popularity of the platform, and also because Netflix is an US company. Here, we see that the US in fact comes in 15th place.

-- Next, we look at the salary data.

SELECT * FROM avg_salary.salary
LIMIT 10;
-- This dataset gives us the average income per country. It contains the below colums:
-- Country | MedianIncome | MeanIncome | Pop2022

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM avg_salary.salary;
-- We have a total of 162 in this set.

-- Now that we've had some time to explore the datasets and get familiarised with them, it's time to perform some statistical analysis to confirm if the hypothesis
-- of the project holds true.

-- Although Netflix is available in 190 countries as of 2022, we only have data for 65, so let's look at these.
-- A left join will ensure that we're looking at combined data from both tables where only the countries available in our Netflix dataset will be available.
-- Let's create a temporary table to save us time and avoid repeating the same query too many times.

WITH subscription_data AS (
    SELECT 
        Country AS country,
        Total_Library_Size AS library_size,
        No__of_TV_Shows AS tv_shows,
        No__of_Movies AS movies,
        Cost_Per_Month___Basic____ AS basic_cost,
        Cost_Per_Month___Standard____ AS standard_cost,
        Cost_Per_Month___Premium____ AS premium_cost,
        meanIncome AS avg_income
        FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions
        JOIN
        avg_salary.salary
        ON Country = _country_
)

SELECT
CORR(basic_cost, avg_income) AS basic_sub_salary_correlation
FROM subscription_data;

-- The result of the above query tells us that the correlation between the basic subscription price and the average salary is 0.57. This means there is 
-- there is a moderate positive correlation between these variables.

-- What about standard and premium prices?

SELECT
CORR(standard_cost, avg_income) AS standard_sub_salary_correlation
FROM subscription_data; -- 0.70

SELECT
CORR(premium_cost, avg_income) AS premium_sub_salary_correlation
FROM subscription_data; -- 0.76

-- The correlation gets closer to 1 as we look at higher price bands. However, this is expected because our average salary variable is not changing, whilst
-- the subscription price is changing every time we calculate the correlation, but we can see an increasing trend and a strong positive correlation for
-- standard and premium subscriptions.

-- We can then come to a conclusion that looking at all the variables there is a correlation between Netflix subscription prices and the average salary.

-- Finally, we want to understand if library size plays any part in subscription prices, so we go through a similar process.

WITH subscription_data AS (
    SELECT 
        Country AS country,
        Total_Library_Size AS library_size,
        No__of_TV_Shows AS tv_shows,
        No__of_Movies AS movies,
        Cost_Per_Month___Basic____ AS basic_cost,
        Cost_Per_Month___Standard____ AS standard_cost,
        Cost_Per_Month___Premium____ AS premium_cost,
        meanIncome AS avg_income
        FROM netflix_subs.subscriptions
        JOIN
        avg_salary.salary
        ON Country = _country_
)

SELECT
CORR(basic_cost, library_size) AS basic_sub_library_correlation
FROM subscription_data;

-- The number 0.02 immediately tells us that there is no relationship between the two variables. We can further check by looking at the other price bands.

SELECT
CORR(standard_cost, library_size) AS standard_sub_library_correlation
FROM subscription_data; -- 0.09

SELECT
CORR(premium_cost, library_size) AS premium_sub_library_correlation
FROM subscription_data; -- 0.07

-- This is unsurprising because Netflix updates its library frequently. If it were to change its pricing depending on library size it would be a poor business
-- model where it would have to maintain a similar number of items constantly, otherwise if prices increased due to library size it would not have a strong
-- popularity or even customers!

-- With this, we can conclude that Netflix subscriptions prices have a positive correlation with average income based on data from 65 countries. However,
-- there is no correlation between prices and library size.
